# Releases and the update package

A release is built only from an owner-created `v*` tag on `main`, by `.github/workflows/release.yml`.
Nothing tags automatically. The same workflow has a lab dry run (`workflow_dispatch`) that builds
with keys made for that run and publishes nothing.

## What a release ships

| Output | Where | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `sneakers-os:<version>` | GHCR, pushed by digest, with its signature | the kit, to build install media |
| `sneakers-appliance-<version>-<arch>.bin` | the GitHub Release the owner created for the tag | the box: downloaded, or uploaded by hand |

The `.bin` is the update package. The box downloads it from the GitHub Release, or an admin
uploads the identical file through :8443 or the console on an air-gapped box. Both paths read it
the same way, and the box contacts no other package source.

## The `.bin` format

```
"SNKRBIN\x01"                         magic
uint32 (big-endian) + header          JSON, below
uint32 (big-endian) + Sigstore bundle cosign sign-blob over the header bytes
age ciphertext                        the payload, to the end of the file
```

The header:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `format`, `name` | `1`, `sneakers-appliance` |
| `version`, `arch` | the release version (SemVer, pre-release identifiers may hold hyphens, as a lab build number does: `0.0.0-lab.20261007d-g1a2b3c4`), `amd64` or `arm64` |
| `kind` | `full`, or `patch` for a hotfix |
| `bases` | a patch's exact base versions; a full version has none |
| `channel` | `production` or `lab` |
| `recipient` | the SHA-256 of the age recipient the payload is encrypted to |
| `payload` | the ciphertext's `sha256` and `size` |

The payload is the signed `sneakers-os` artifact as an OCI layout (an uncompressed tar with fixed
owners, modes and times, so the same layout gives the same bytes). The box still runs the whole
verification chain ([artifact.md](artifact.md)) on what it unpacks.

The box reads a package in this order, and refuses with the first code that applies:

1. The framing and the header parse (`UPGRADE_FORMAT`).
2. The header's signature verifies with the release key compiled into the running init
   (`UPGRADE_SIGNATURE`). A package from the other channel is `UPGRADE_CHANNEL`.
3. The signed header's channel is the box's (`UPGRADE_CHANNEL`).
4. The ciphertext's size and SHA-256 equal the header's (`UPGRADE_SIGNATURE`).
5. Only then is it decrypted with the update key read from the UKI that booted
   (`UPGRADE_DECRYPT`; see below).
6. A patch applies only on one of its exact base versions (`UPGRADE_PATCH_BASE`).

`sneakers-artifact` writes and checks packages: `bin-pack` encrypts a layout and writes the header
to sign, `bin-seal` joins the header, its bundle and the ciphertext, and `bin-verify` runs steps 1
to 4. Given `--identity` (an age key file) or `--identity-uki` (a UKI, read the way the box reads
it), it also decrypts, and with `--extract` unpacks the payload.

## Lab and production keys

The release key (which signs the artifact and the `.bin` header) and the update key (which the
payload is encrypted to) each have a lab and a production variant:

- **Production:** the public halves are committed in `keys/production/` (`cosign.pub`,
  `update.pub`, recorded in `fingerprints.txt`). Both private halves are secrets of the
  `production` environment (`RELEASE_COSIGN_KEY` and `UPDATE_AGE_KEY`,
  [runbooks/production-keys.md](runbooks/production-keys.md)). Encrypting needs only `update.pub`;
  the update key's private half is read only by the sign step that adds it to the UKI.
- **Lab:** `build/keys/lab-keys.sh` makes a fresh set per run, every key labelled
  `LAB ephemeral NOT FOR PRODUCTION`, on a tmpfs that's unmounted at the end of the job.

## The update key in the UKI

The box decrypts with an update key it carries in its signed UKI, as a PE section of its own,
`.updkey`:

- The sign job writes `UPDATE_AGE_KEY` to the key tmpfs, and `sneakers-artifact uki-add-key` adds
  it to the unsigned UKI. The tool refuses a key that doesn't belong to the committed
  `update.pub`, a UKI that's already signed, and a UKI that already has a key. The key file is
  removed in the same step, then the db key signs the keyed UKI, so the signature covers the key.
- On the box the key is read from the UKI systemd-boot booted (the entry `LoaderEntrySelected`
  names, found under `EFI/Linux` on the ESP) into memory only; it's never written anywhere. A UKI
  without the section is `UPGRADE_DECRYPT`.
- systemd-stub doesn't measure `.updkey`, and `internal/ukipcr` skips it too, so the key doesn't
  change PCR 11 or the box's sealing.
- The sign job checks the finished `.bin` decrypts with the key read back out of the signed UKI.
- A lab build does the same with its lab update key (`build/lab/build.sh`).

The trade-off: the encryption protects the package in transit and on download mirrors, not from
someone who holds a genuine image. Anyone with a genuine image (the published `sneakers-os`
artifact, install media or a box's ESP) can read the update key out of its UKI. A package's
authenticity comes from its signature, never from the encryption: a box installs only what the
release key signed for its channel, whoever could decrypt it.

A lab `.bin` is named `-LAB.bin`, after a version that carries its build number (`-g<short
commit>`, [testing.md](testing.md#the-lab-release)), signed with the lab key and encrypted to the lab update key, so a
production box refuses it, and the reverse. The sign job runs `check-fingerprints.sh` and refuses
any certificate or key that isn't the recorded production one.

## The workflow

| Job | Holds | Does |
|---|---|---|
| `guard` | nothing | refuses a tag that isn't `v<semver>` or whose commit isn't on `main`, and a production release before `keys/production/fingerprints.txt` and the `SNEAKERS_RELEASE_VERSION` pin (`build/release/pins.env`) exist |
| `build` | nothing | builds the kernel, the root image, the unsigned UKI and systemd-boot, the production kit, and `SHA256SUMS` over all of it (`build/release/build.sh`) |
| `sign` | the `production` environment | checks `SHA256SUMS` and the fingerprints; adds the update key to the UKI; signs the UKI and systemd-boot with the db key, then the artifact and the `.bin` header with the release key; checks the `.bin` decrypts with the key in the signed UKI; each key is written to a tmpfs only in the step that uses it and removed there, and the tmpfs is unmounted at the end |
| `publish` | `packages: write`, `contents: write` | verifies the artifact with the production kit and the `.bin` with the production key, pushes `sneakers-os` to GHCR, verifies what it pushed, and attaches the `.bin` and its `.sha256` to the tag's GitHub Release |
| `lab` | lab keys only | the whole path with a lab key set: builds (the lab update key in the UKI), packs, verifies, decrypts with the key in the signed UKI, unpacks, runs the lab kit on the result, and checks a production verify of the lab `.bin` is refused; nothing leaves the run |

The release `release.yaml` and its signature come from the pinned `sneakers-release` GitHub
Release; the k0s binary from its upstream release, checked against the pin in `release.yaml`. The
images bundle, the charts and the platform add-ons join the payload as their builds land; every
image in it is signed with the release key, third-party ones included. amd64 only for now; arm64
follows its kernel build.
