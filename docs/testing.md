# Testing

| What | Where | When |
|---|---|---|
| Unit tests (the chain, the writers, init, custody, Secure Boot, the upgrade stager) | `go test ./...` | every PR (`🧪 Build & Test`) |
| Tool interop (efitools, cosign, sbsign, sbverify, unsquashfs, ukify against the kit's checks) | `go test -tags tools ./test/kit/labkeys/` | every PR (`🔑 Lab keys and tool interop`) |
| The root image: reproducible, the declared tree, its refusals | `bash build/root/build_test.sh` | every PR (`🔑 Lab keys and tool interop`) |
| The airgap bundle: pull by digest per architecture, signatures, both-way check (a `registry:2` container) | `go test ./internal/bundle/` | every PR (`🧪 Build & Test`) |
| Kernel and static tools | `job-image-build.yaml` | PRs that touch their inputs |
| The image suite (QEMU, OVMF Secure Boot, swtpm) | `go test -tags image ./test/image/...` | every PR (`image-e2e.yml`) |

Tests that need a tool skip with its name when it's missing; CI sets `SNEAKERS_REQUIRE_TOOLS=1`, so
there a missing tool fails instead.

## The lab release

`build/lab/build.sh` builds a whole release the way the release workflow does, signed with a key
set `build/keys/lab-keys.sh` makes for that run only: the (empty) airgap bundle
(`build/bundle/build.sh`), the root image (`build/root/build.sh`, with the static OpenSSH and
busybox), the
UKI (`build/uki/assemble.sh`, signed with `sbsign`), systemd-boot (signed), the enrolment
material, `release.yaml` and the artifact (`sneakers-artifact assemble`, then `cosign sign-blob`
over the index blob and `sneakers-artifact attach`). It then builds a kit pinned to that run's keys
and writes the raw disk with it, so every PR runs the kit's whole chain against a real release. In
CI the keys live on a tmpfs that's unmounted at the end of the job; nothing built is uploaded.

## The QEMU harness

`test/image/harness` boots a disk on q35 with SMM and OVMF's Secure Boot build, a vars store with
the run's lab PK, KEK and db enrolled (`virt-fw-vars`), or an empty one for Setup Mode, swtpm as
the TPM, KVM when the runner has it, and the serial console in a file the tests match against. On a
failure the last lines of the console go to the test log and the job summary.
